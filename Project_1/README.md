## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

In case of any errors with map genaration please run this installation commends:\
!pip install geopy\
!pip install geocode\
But the code should with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

We are trying to answer a couple of questions with the use of Boston AirB&B data:

1. What are the most common ammenities in the listed object and do they matter in price prediction?
2. How good of a price prediction we can get with available data?
3. Can we find the clusturs of the objects the are similar to the neighborhoods?

All of the used files are available in in this repository. This project was done to compete Project 1 from Udacity Nanodegree. 


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one notebook available with data analysis and prediction steps. Every step is explained with the use of markdowns and comments.

Data file which originally was downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston is added to the repository

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the text available [here](https://medium.com/@gienekszwed/boston-airb-b-price-prediction-and-objects-clustering-4a15c08495de).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Air B&B for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
